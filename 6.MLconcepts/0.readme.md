# 26. What is Machine Learning?
## what is machine learning?
- ML is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.
- Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.

- [NN] Neural networks are a way of modeling biological neuron system mathematically.
    - These networks can then be used to solve tasks that many other types of algorithms can not (e.g. image classification)
- [DNN] Deep Learning simply refers to neural networks with more thann one hidden layer.

## ML process
  - data acquisition ->  data cleaning -> [test data] / [model training & building] -> model testing -> adjust model parameters -> model deplyment

# 27. Supervised Learning
- Supervised learning algorithms are trained usingn labeled examples
- Oftenly, split data into 3 sets
    - training data
        - used to train model parameters
    - validation data
        - used to determine what model hyperparameters to adjust
    - test data
        - used to get some final performance metric

# 28. Overfitting
- Overfittinng
    - The model fits too much to the noise from the data
    - This often results in **low error on training sets** but **high error on test/validation sets**
